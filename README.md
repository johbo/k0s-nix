# k0s-nix Flake

This repository contains a Nix Flake which provides the necessary utilities to
use `k0s` inside of a NixOS system.


## Status - EXPERIMENTAL

The implementation is in its early phase. It is possible to use and make work
(with a few manual twists) for early inspection.


## Module options

The options of the NixOS module are documented at
<https://nix-community.github.io/k0s-nix/>.


## Contributions

Both contributions and forks are welcome, also if this should ever reach a state
which could be integrated upstream into Nixpkgs then we would happily archive
this Flake for it.


## Usage

### Use the module in your own flake

Add this flake as an input, import `nixosModules.default`, and apply
`overlays.default`:

<!-- readme-example -->
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-26.05";
    k0s-nix.url = "github:nix-community/k0s-nix";
    k0s-nix.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs =
    { nixpkgs, k0s-nix, ... }:
    {
      nixosConfigurations.my-node = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        modules = [
          ./hardware-configuration.nix
          k0s-nix.nixosModules.default
          {
            nixpkgs.overlays = [ k0s-nix.overlays.default ];

            services.k0s = {
              enable = true;
              role = "single";
              spec.api.address = "192.0.2.1";
            };

            system.stateVersion = "26.05";
          }
        ];
      };
    };
}
```

The overlay is not optional: `services.k0s.package` defaults to `pkgs.k0s`,
which Nixpkgs does not provide. It also supplies `k0s_<version>`: one for each k8s version not considered EoL (current + last 3 minor versions).

`spec.api.address` has no default; `192.0.2.1` stands in for the address the
node binds its API to.


### Validate the generated configuration

The module renders `/etc/k0s/k0s.yaml` from `services.k0s.spec`. Build
`validatedConfigFile` in your own flake to have `k0s config validate` run
over the result:

```sh
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.<host>.config.services.k0s.validatedConfigFile
```

The option types reject a malformed value, and k0s reports the combinations
they cannot see:

```
Error: spec: network: calico.mode: Forbidden: dual-stack for calico is only supported for mode `bird`
```

Set `services.k0s.enableConfigCheck = true` to add it to `system.checks`, so
that `nixos-rebuild` fails on an invalid configuration instead of the node
reporting it later. k0s runs the same validation when the controller starts
and refuses to start on an error, so this only moves the failure earlier.

It is off by default because k0s validates against the host as well as the
file, and a build has no host to offer. Control plane load balancing is one
such case; `hostDependentCases` in `checks/config.nix` demonstrates it.

The check is also skipped where the builder cannot execute
`services.k0s.package`, as when cross building.


### Token handling to join the cluster

Whether a node needs a join token follows from its role:

- `worker` always needs one.
- `controller` and `controller+worker` need one to join an existing cluster,
  unless it uses an external `etcd` (`spec.storage.etcd.externalCluster`).
- `single`, and the controller carrying `services.k0s.controller.isLeader`,
  never need one.

Generate a join token by running `k0s token create --role=worker` (or `--role=controller` accordingly) on the controller carrying `services.k0s.controller.isLeader`. It will be written to `stdout`.

Place the token in the file `services.k0s.tokenFile` names, `/etc/k0s/k0stoken`
by default. While a token is required and that file is absent, systemd skips
the unit instead of failing it: `k0s.service` stays inactive and reports no
error.

The token is only read when joining. Afterwards the file may be emptied, but it
has to remain: the condition is checked on every start, not only the first.

The module does not provision the token. Placing it on the node is the
consumer's own step.


## Known limitations


### `k0s` is included as a binary

`k0s` is currently included as a binary. It would be better to replicate the
build process so that it would be built from sources.

The following pull requests and issues around Nixpkgs are related to this:

- Attempt to add `k0s` 2026-01: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/479140
- Attempt to package the binary from 2023-10: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/258846
- Package request issue from 2023-08: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/247158

## Releases

Every commit on the `main` branch should be considered "stable" and directly usable.
The CI process runs a small, but growing, suite of tests on every pull request before it is merged and cover common use-cases.

Version upgrades to the k0s binary will occur in a relatively timely manner.
The `k0s` nix package attribute will change minor versions from time to time (i.e.: `1.33.x -> 1.34.x`).

Most users can use this flake from its `main` branch. Users that wish to keep a more
stable base can point at a specific commit `sha` instead of the `main` branch,
e.g. in their `flake.nix` file, like so:

```
{
  inputs = {
    k0s-nix.url = "github:nix-community/k0s-nix/cfdbd7ace82d6437aaa9324a53d70cf3521ef22c";
  }
}
```

### Breaking changes

Since there are no releases, changes that need attention when moving a pin forward are noted here.

**2026-08-20, merge commit `63278bd`: the systemd unit is called `k0s` for every role.**

Before this the unit was `k0scontroller` on a controller and `k0sworker` on a worker.
Both are now `k0s`, whatever `services.k0s.role` is set to.
Anything naming the old units has to be updated: `systemctl` invocations, monitoring checks,
and `systemd` drop-ins or ordering dependencies declared in your own configuration.
A `systemd.services.k0scontroller` override in particular no longer reaches the unit, and does not fail.

The switch itself needs no manual step.
`switch-to-configuration` stops the old unit before it starts `k0s.service`,
and neither `containerd` nor `kubelet` survives from the old one;
the switch test on the `unit-rename-evidence` tag covers this.
The k0s process does restart, so the node is briefly unavailable.
